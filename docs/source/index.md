## What is OpenEnv?

**OpenEnv** is an end-to-end framework designed to standardize how agents interact with execution environments during reinforcement learning (RL) training. At its core, OpenEnv provides a consistent, Gymnasium-compatible interface through three simple APIs: `step()`, `reset()`, and `state()`.

### Why OpenEnv?

Training RL agents—especially in agentic settings like code generation, web browsing, or game playing—requires environments that are:

- **Isolated**: Each agent instance runs in its own sandboxed environment, preventing interference and ensuring reproducibility.
- **Scalable**: Environments can be deployed as HTTP services or containerized with Docker, enabling distributed training across clusters.
- **Standardized**: A unified API means researchers and practitioners can switch between environments without rewriting integration code.

OpenEnv bridges the gap between environment creators and RL practitioners:

- **For Researchers & Framework Authors**: Interact with any OpenEnv-compatible environment using familiar Gymnasium-style APIs—no need to learn environment-specific protocols.
- **For Environment Creators**: Build rich, production-ready environments with built-in support for HTTP deployment, Docker packaging, and security isolation.
