"""
Synthetic transaction stream generator for the Fraud Triage Environment.

Generates a stream of transactions with a configurable fraud rate. Legitimate
and fraudulent transactions are drawn from different feature distributions so
the task is learnable but not trivial -- fraud correlates with, but is not
perfectly determined by, any single feature (mirroring real payment data,
where no single rule catches everything).

This is intentionally dependency-light (pure Python + random) so the
environment has no heavyweight ML dependencies at the server layer -- an
agent is expected to learn the decision policy, not have one handed to it.
