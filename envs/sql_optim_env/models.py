Data models for the SQL Query Optimization environment.

Defines the `Action`, `Observation`, and `State` wire types exchanged between
the [`SQLOptimEnv`][envs.sql_optim_env.client.SQLOptimEnv] client and the
environment server. All three inherit from the OpenEnv base types so they
serialize over the WebSocket/HTTP transport.

    Action emitted by the agent for one optimization step.

    Attributes:
        suggestions (`list[dict]`):
            Detected issues. Each entry is a dict with `issue_type`, `line`,
            `description`, `severity`, and `fix` keys.
        optimized_query (`str`):
            The complete rewritten SQL. It is executed against the real DuckDB
            data so the measured speedup can be rewarded.
        summary (`str`):
            Overall analysis and performance profile of the query.
        estimated_improvement (`str`):
            The agent's own expected speedup (e.g. `"10x faster"`).
        approved (`bool`):
            `True` if the agent judges the query already optimal, `False` if it
            still needs changes.

    Observation returned to the agent after `reset` and each `step`.

    Inherits `done`, `reward`, and `metadata` from
    [`~openenv.core.env_server.Observation`]. The composite reward breakdown,
    per-criterion feedback, and full execution comparison are attached under
    `metadata` (keys `reward_breakdown`, `feedback`, `execution`).

    Attributes:
        task_id (`str`):
            Identifier of the active task.
        task_name (`str`):
            Human-readable task name.
        task_description (`str`):
            What the agent must do for this task.
        sql_query (`str`):
            The slow SQL query to analyze and rewrite.
        schema_info (`str`):
            Table schema, row counts, and index notes.
        dialect (`str`):
            SQL dialect the query targets.
        difficulty (`str`):
            One of `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `expert`.
        step_count (`int`):
            Steps taken so far in this episode.
        max_steps (`int`):
            Maximum steps allowed for this task.
        issues_found_so_far (`list[str]`):
            Issue types the agent flagged in previous steps.
        last_execution (`dict`, *optional*):
