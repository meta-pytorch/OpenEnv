"""`HarborSession` is what lets a stock TRL rollout worker train on a hosted Harbor server.

TRL's loop-owning path calls `create()` -> `wait_for_completion()` -> `fetch_proxy_trace()` ->
`verify()`, and knows nothing else. Satisfying that contract is what makes the training script the
stock one, with nothing added to TRL. These tests pin the parts where getting it subtly wrong would
look like a working run:

  * an EVAL rollout must yield NO trainable turns, not rows of zeros
  * a failed rollout must return non-zero rather than raise, because an exception in the rollout loop
    takes down every training rank waiting on the next batch
  * an ungraded rollout must report `None`, never 0 — a crashed rollout is not a wrong answer
  * a prompt must map back to the task the server actually has
