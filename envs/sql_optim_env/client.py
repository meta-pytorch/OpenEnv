    Client for the SQL Query Optimization environment.

    The agent receives a slow SQL query plus its schema, returns a
    [`SQLOptimAction`][envs.sql_optim_env.models.SQLOptimAction] with a
    rewritten `optimized_query`, and is rewarded by real DuckDB execution
    speedup and result-correctness.

    Examples:

    ```python
    with SQLOptimEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000").sync() as env:
        obs = env.reset(task_id="task_1_basic_antipatterns").observation
