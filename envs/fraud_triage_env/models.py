"""
Data models for the Fraud Triage Environment.

This module defines the Action, Observation, and State types for a
sequential transaction-risk-decisioning task exposed through the OpenEnv
interface.

An agent is streamed one transaction at a time and must decide how to
handle it. The environment rewards catching fraud while penalizing false
positives (blocking or escalating legitimate transactions) and false
negatives (approving fraudulent ones) at different weights, mirroring the
asymmetric cost structure real payment/fraud teams operate under.

    Observation for the Fraud Triage environment.

    Represents a single transaction with engineered risk features, similar

    would compute in real time.

    Attributes:
        transaction_id: Unique identifier for this transaction.
        amount: Transaction amount, normalized to the account's typical range.
        merchant_category: Coarse merchant category code (0-9, synthetic).
        velocity_1h: Number of transactions on this account in the last hour.
        velocity_24h: Number of transactions on this account in the last 24h.
        amount_zscore: How many standard deviations this amount is from the
            account's historical mean transaction size.
        is_new_merchant: Whether this merchant has never been used by this
            account before.
        is_new_device: Whether this transaction originates from a device
            not previously associated with this account.
        cross_border: Whether the transaction crosses a national border.
        hour_of_day: Hour (0-23) the transaction occurred, local to the account.
        account_age_days: Age of the account in days.
        legal_actions: The list of valid TriageDecision values (always all four
            here, but included for interface consistency with other envs).
        done: Whether the episode (transaction stream) has ended.
