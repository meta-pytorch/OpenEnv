"""The Pelican SVG environment.

One episode is one drawing. `reset()` samples a task and returns the prompt,
`step()` scores the submitted SVG and ends the episode. Keeping episodes to a
single exchange is deliberate: the thing being measured is whether a model can
hold a spatial arrangement in its head and emit coordinates for it blind, and
letting it iterate would measure something else.

):
    """Scores SVG drawings of an animal riding a vehicle.

    Args:
        subject (`str`, *optional*):
            Fix the animal instead of sampling one. Pair with `vehicle` to pin
            the task entirely, which is what a leaderboard run wants. Pinning
            just one fills the other from the canonical pelican-bicycle pair,
            and any pin takes precedence over `sample_tasks`.
        vehicle (`str`, *optional*):
            Fix the vehicle instead of sampling one.
        sample_tasks (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Draw a random task on every reset instead of always serving Simon
            Willison's pelican-and-bicycle prompt. Off by default, because a
            default that changes on every reset silently makes two runs
            incomparable.
        held_out_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Sample, but never the pelican-and-bicycle prompt. Implies
            `sample_tasks`. This is a hard promise: a pin that resolves to the
            canonical task raises `ValueError` rather than serving it.
        judge ([`VisionJudge`], *optional*):
            Semantic scorer. When omitted and `enable_judge` is `True`, one is
            built from a Hugging Face Inference Providers token if the ambient
            environment supplies one.
        enable_judge (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Set `False` to score with the deterministic layers only. Passing
            `judge=None` on its own does not disable the judge, it just asks
            for the default one.
        return_image (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Include the rendered PNG in the observation as base64. Useful for
            building a leaderboard gallery, wasteful during training.

    Examples:

    ```python
    env = PelicanSvgEnvironment(subject="capybara", vehicle="unicycle")
    observation = env.reset()
    print(observation.prompt)
