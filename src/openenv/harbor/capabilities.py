"""What can this server actually run, right now?

A client should not have to guess. `capabilities()` answers three questions in one call — which
harnesses exist and how well each is trusted, which sandboxes have working credentials, and which
datasets are served — so the failure "you asked for a sandbox whose API key is missing" happens at
discovery time instead of 90 seconds into a rollout.

Credential checks reuse Harbor's own `preflight()` per backend rather than reimplementing key
lookups. Two things about that call have to be handled and are easy to miss:

  * it raises **`SystemExit`**, a `BaseException`, so a bare `except Exception` will not catch it and
    the server process dies instead of reporting an unavailable sandbox
  * `EnvironmentFactory.run_preflight` is never called by `Job.create()` — only Harbor's CLI calls
    it — so a library caller gets no credential validation at all unless it asks
