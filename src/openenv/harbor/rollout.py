**Nothing raises out of `run_rollout`.** A failed rollout returns `ok=False` with `reward=None`. That
is not defensive habit, it is the reason this layer exists: in the white-box predecessor a rollout
exception reached the trainer and hung every rank at the NCCL barrier forever, so every method there
had to be individually wrapped. Behind a result object that failure mode cannot occur.

#
# Others read it at RUN time instead: Harbor's goose wrapper does so inside its own `run`
# (goose.py:653). So the override is held across `Trial.create` AND `trial.run()` whenever a seam
# carries `proc_env`, because restoring it in between handed goose the operator's real provider key
# and earned a 401 from our own proxy on every call.
#
# That channel is global, so two concurrent rollouts of a proc-env harness would overwrite each
# other's session key, and holding it across the whole trial means those rollouts serialise. That is
# not an implementation shortcut but a property of the agent: it reads a process-global variable at
# run time, so per-rollout isolation is impossible without a process per rollout. Seams that pass
# credentials through `agent_env` — most of them — neither take the lock nor wait on it.
#
# A `threading.Lock`, not an `asyncio.Lock`. What is being protected is `os.environ`, which is global
# to the PROCESS, not to an event loop, and rollouts arrive on several loops: the env server answers
# each request on its own loop, and any caller using `asyncio.run` per rollout creates another. An
# asyncio lock binds to the first loop that uses it and then raises
