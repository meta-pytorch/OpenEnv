"""Everything that must be true before the server accepts a request.

Four checks, in the order that fails cheapest first:

1. **LLM** — is it reachable, and what can it return? A vLLM without
   `--return-tokens-as-token-ids --logprobs-mode processed_logprobs` answers every request perfectly
   well and returns no ids, so every rebuilt training row would be empty with nothing reporting an
   error. That failure has no loud edge, so the endpoint is probed first and the answer — the capture
   level — is attached to everything this server later produces. Only an *unreachable* endpoint is
   fatal: one that cannot return token ids is an eval backend, and saying so loudly beats refusing to
   start, since every hosted provider lands in that category.
2. **sandbox credentials** — via Harbor's own `preflight()`, so the message names the exact missing
   variable rather than us guessing at one.
3. **datasets** — resolved and downloaded up front. A 2000-task repo takes real time to fetch, and a
   mistyped dataset name should fail here rather than on the first rollout.
4. **report** — print what is usable and, more usefully, what is not and why.

A caller gets the same `Capabilities` object the server serves over the wire, so what is printed at
startup and what a client can query are the same data.
