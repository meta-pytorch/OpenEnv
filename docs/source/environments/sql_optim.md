# SQL Query Optimization Environment

An **execution-grounded** environment for training agents to write fast SQL. The
agent is given a slow query plus its schema and must return a rewrite. Reward is
**not** a keyword heuristic: the environment runs both the original and the
optimized query against a real in-memory **DuckDB** database seeded with
realistic synthetic data (10k users, 500k orders, 1k products, 1M events), then
scores the agent on measured speedup and result-correctness.

Five tasks scale from basic anti-patterns to expert window-function audits.

## Quick Start

```python
from sql_optim_env import SQLOptimAction, SQLOptimEnv

with SQLOptimEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000").sync() as env:
    obs = env.reset(task_id="task_1_basic_antipatterns").observation
    print(obs.sql_query)          # the slow query to fix
    print(obs.schema_info)        # tables, row counts

    result = env.step(
        SQLOptimAction(
            suggestions=[
                {"issue_type": "select_star", "line": 1,
                 "description": "SELECT * reads every column", "severity": "high",
                 "fix": "project only the needed columns"},
            ],
            optimized_query="SELECT id FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5000",
            summary="Dropped SELECT * and the non-sargable CAST.",
            estimated_improvement="~10x faster",
            approved=False,
        )
    )
    print(result.reward, result.done)
    print(result.metadata["reward_breakdown"])
    print(result.metadata["execution"]["speedup"])   # real DuckDB speedup
```

Async usage mirrors the other environments:

```python
async with SQLOptimEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as env:
    result = await env.reset(task_id="task_1_basic_antipatterns")
```

## Action

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `suggestions` | `list[dict]` | Issues found: `issue_type`, `line`, `description`, `severity`, `fix` |
| `optimized_query` | `str` | The rewritten SQL — executed for real |
| `summary` | `str` | Overall analysis |
| `estimated_improvement` | `str` | Agent's own speedup estimate |
| `approved` | `bool` | `True` if the query is already optimal |

## Observation

`sql_query`, `schema_info`, `task_description`, `difficulty`, `step_count`,
`max_steps`, `issues_found_so_far`, and `last_execution` (the previous step's
real timing comparison, so the agent can refine its rewrite). The step reward is
on `reward`; the composite `reward_breakdown`, `feedback`, and full `execution`
comparison are under `metadata`.

## Reward

Composite score in `[0, 1]`, computed inside the environment:

| Component | Weight | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Execution speedup | 35% | real DuckDB timing ratio |
| Result correctness | 20% | do both queries return identical rows? |
| Issue detection | 25% | flagged issues vs. ground truth |
| Approval correctness | 8% | correctly judged the query bad/good |
| Summary quality | 7% | thoroughness of the written analysis |
| Severity labels | 5% | severities present |

## Tasks

Five tasks (`task_1_basic_antipatterns` … `task_5_*`) covering `SELECT *`,
non-sargable predicates, functions on filter columns, join ordering, and window
functions, spanning `easy` → `expert`.
