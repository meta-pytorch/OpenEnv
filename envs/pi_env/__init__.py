"""Pi environment for OpenEnv.

Two layers in this package:

1. **Harness primitive** — :class:`PiSessionFactory` / :class:`PiSession` /
   :class:`PiConfig` / :class:`PiTask`. Used in-process to drive one rollout
   inside a sandbox. See ``harness.py``.

2. **Deployable env** — :class:`PiEnv` (MCP client) talks to the FastAPI
   server at ``server/app.py`` over HTTP. Use this when the sandbox + agent
   live behind an HTTP boundary (e.g. an HF Space). See ``client.py`` and
   ``server/``.

The sandbox backend and interception proxy are shared with ``opencode_env``
(to be consolidated into ``openenv.core``).
