"""Work out what an inference endpoint can actually return, before anything is spent on it.

This runs BEFORE a server binds a port, and grading honestly here is the entire point.

An engine missing `--return-tokens-as-token-ids --logprobs-mode processed_logprobs` still answers
every request perfectly well: it returns text, a `200`, and plausible-looking usage. What it does not
return is token ids. Every row rebuilt downstream is then empty, training silently does nothing, and
the first symptom is a loss curve that never moves days later. That failure has no loud edge, so the
check has to be up front — and the answer has to travel with everything the endpoint later produces.

The probe therefore settles a **capture level**, not a yes/no:

    tokens      prompt ids, sampled ids, aligned logprobs. Trainable. vLLM with the two flags, or
                SGLang from main.
    logprobs    logprobs, no ids. Not trainable: an unpaired logprob has no token to attach to.
    text        neither.

Below `tokens` the endpoint is an eval backend — reward and full trace, no token fields — which is a
real, useful thing rather than a failure, so the server runs instead of refusing. What it must never
do is present an eval rollout as a training one, which is why the level is stamped on the result and
no contract is written without `tokens`.

The probe also **negotiates**: hosted providers reject the capture params, and reject them per model
rather than per endpoint. `return_token_ids` is a 400 on OpenAI; `logprobs` is a 400 on every current
OpenAI model; `max_tokens` and `temperature: 0` are 400s there too. So a rejection is read (see
`compat.diagnose`), the offending param is dropped or renamed, and the request is retried — the level
is decided by what finally came back, never by what we hoped to send.

Two engines implement the contract. vLLM, served with
`--return-tokens-as-token-ids --logprobs-mode processed_logprobs`. And SGLang built from `main`:
sgl-project/sglang#30917 (merged 2026-07-23) added `return_token_ids` to the OpenAI-compatible
routes, which is what sgl-project/sglang#18378 had asked for. Released SGLang is still unusable —
v0.5.16 carries only `return_prompt_token_ids`, the prompt without the sampled ids — so the version
matters and nothing but a live probe can tell the two apart, which is what this file does. SGLang
also puts the prompt ids per choice rather than at the top level; `normalize_response` absorbs that,
so the probe below runs its payload through it before grading.

A hosted alternative exists but is narrow: fireworks-ai via the HF router honours vLLM's
`return_token_ids`, though every one of its live models is a reasoning model whose reasoning tokens
are dropped from history, so multi-turn stitching degrades to per-turn.

    """Whether an endpoint's logprobs are the sampling distribution's or the raw pre-temperature ones.

    This closes the one hole no other check here can see. vLLM's `logprobs_mode` defaults to
    `raw_logprobs` (`vllm/config/model.py`), documented as the values "before applying any logit
    processors, **including temperature and top_k/top_p**". Raw logprobs are aligned, negative,
    correctly counted, and wrong: GRPO's importance ratio needs the logprob under the policy that
    actually sampled the token. `token_ids` arrives either way, because it comes from the request
    parameter rather than from a serving flag, so an engine launched with neither flag produces a
    rollout that grades as fully trainable and trains on the wrong numbers.

    The test follows from the definition, and compares the GAP between the top two tokens rather
    than absolute values. That matters: processed logprobs are `logsoftmax(logits / T)`, so a
    difference between two of them is `(logit_a - logit_b) / T` — the normalising constant cancels.
    The gap is therefore invariant under renormalisation and under any per-replica offset, which
    absolute comparison is not. A first attempt compared values directly and misread a
    data-parallel engine (DP=4) as processed, because consecutive calls landed on different replicas.

    Measured, three repeats each, on two live Qwen3.5-4B servers:

        --logprobs-mode processed_logprobs   gap 6.7500 @T=1.0  ->  3.3750 @T=2.0   ratio 0.500
        default (raw_logprobs)               gap 6.7500 @T=1.0  ->  6.7500 @T=2.0   ratio 1.000

    So the expected ratio is `T1 / T2` when processed and `1.0` when raw, and the two are a factor of
    two apart. No `seed` is sent and the sampled token is ignored: `top_logprobs` at the first
    position is a property of the prompt and the temperature alone.
