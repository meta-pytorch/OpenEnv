# OpenClaw Environment Dependencies
# Core dependencies are inherited from openenv-base image
# Add environment-specific dependencies here

# No additional dependencies required for core functionality
# The environment uses standard library modules for:
# - subprocess (shell execution)
# - pathlib (file operations)
# - tempfile (workspace management)
