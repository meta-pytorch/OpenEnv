"""Wire types for harbor_env.

Two shapes matter. `HarborTaskRef` is what the Task API hands out during discovery, one per dataset
item. `HarborRolloutResult` is what one `run_rollout` returns: the reward, and enough token detail to
train on.

Everything here is JSON-serialisable by construction — `run_rollout` returns
`result.model_dump_json()` and the client re-validates, matching how `opencode_env` and `pi_env` do
it. There is no shared memory between server and client.
