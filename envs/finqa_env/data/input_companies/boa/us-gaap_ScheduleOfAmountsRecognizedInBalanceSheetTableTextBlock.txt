The estimate of the Corporation’s PBO associated with these plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2024 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of $<ix:nonfraction contextref="c-1" decimals="-6" id="fact-identifier-6071" inside-table="false" ix="f-5173" name="bac:DefinedBenefitPlanBenefitObligationIncreaseDecreaseFromChangeInWeightedAverageDiscountRates" scale="6" sign="-" unitref="usd">767</ix:nonfraction> million at December 31, 2024.

Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric>
