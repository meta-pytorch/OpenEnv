Compare multiple LLMs playing Kuhn Poker via HF Inference Providers.

Uses OpenAI client with HuggingFace router to access models through
HuggingFace Inference Providers API.

Kuhn Poker is a simplified 2-player poker game - a classic game theory benchmark
for imperfect information games. The agent plays against a random bot.

Game Rules:
- 3 cards: Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K)
- Each player gets 1 card (private)
- Each player antes 1 chip
- Actions: PASS/FOLD (0) or BET/CALL (1)
- Higher card wins if showdown

This script:
1. Tests multiple models on the same games
2. Compares strategic reasoning abilities
3. Ranks models by performance (chips won vs random opponent)

Usage:
    # Start OpenSpiel server:
    export OPENSPIEL_GAME=kuhn_poker
    python -m envs.openspiel_env.server.app
    
    # Set HF token:
    export HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
    
    # Run comparison:
    python examples/kuhn_poker_inference.py
    
    # Add more models by editing MODELS list in script
    # Use "model_name:provider" format (e.g., ":hyperbolic", ":deepinfra")
