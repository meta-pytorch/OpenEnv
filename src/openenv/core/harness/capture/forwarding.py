"""Publish the intercept server at a URL the sandbox can reach.

The agent runs inside a sandbox on the public internet; the intercept runs next to the engine on a
cluster node with no inbound connectivity. Exactly one hop must be forwarded, and it is this one.
The engine itself never needs exposing: it stays on localhost behind the intercept.

`PortForwarder` is that hop, as a swappable strategy. Three implementations, chosen by what the
sandbox actually is rather than by preference:

    DirectExposure    the sandbox can already route to us (local docker, same VPC). No third party,
                      no expiry, no throughput ceiling. Prefer this whenever it is true.
    GradioForwarder      frpc via gradio.networking.setup_tunnel.
    CloudflareForwarder  cloudflared quick forwards, or a named forwards in production.

MEASURED, not assumed. Over a full day of harness bring-up on one intercept:

    gradio / frpc     521 POSTs, ZERO forwarding errors in the server log, ~370ms health round trip,
                      still up after 24h.
    cloudflared       10765 log lines on the sibling experiment, with repeated
                      `failed to accept QUIC stream: timeout`, `datagram manager encountered a
                      failure while serving`, and `lookup region1.v2.argotunnel.com: i/o timeout`.
                      It always reconnected, so this is churn rather than outage, but it is churn.

So gradio is the better default at eval scale. Cloudflare earns its place elsewhere: quick forwards
expire in a way named forwards do not, and a named forwards gives a stable hostname, real access
policies, and no shared relay. gradio.live URLs expire at 72h and are a single frpc hop, which is
fine for a sweep and a bottleneck at GRPO group width.

SHARE TOKENS ARE NOT AUTH. `share_token` identifies the forward to the share server; the resulting
URL is public either way. What protects the GPU behind it is the intercept's own key check, which is
why `SessionRegistry.require_registered` defaults to True.
