        Probably unnoticed upstream because the line is suppressed for `stopReason == "end_turn"`

        reports `stop`, so for us it is always printed.

            while IFS= read -r line; do ... case "$line" in *'"id":"1"'*) break ;; esac; done
            ...; kill 0)

    `sleep 86400` holds stdin open for a day, and `kill 0` tears down the whole process group once
    the terminating wire event arrives. Harbor already expects part of the fallout and swallows
    `NonZeroAgentExitCodeError` for "exit 143" (SIGTERM). What it does not expect is that killing the
    group also kills the E2B exec stream mid-flight, so the HTTP/2 connection on the HOST side dies:

        httpcore.RemoteProtocolError: <StreamReset stream_id:67, error_code:2, remote_reset:True>
        (raised in .venv312/site-packages/httpcore/_async/http2.py, i.e. OUR process, not the sandbox)

    That propagates out of `run`, so Harbor abandons the trial and never runs the verifier. Every one
    of 11 kimi trials died this way, each AFTER completing real work (one had 37 captured turns), and
    no other harness has ever produced this error on the same E2B backend, which is what identifies
    it as kimi's teardown rather than transport flakiness.

    By the time it fires, kimi has already written its wire output to /logs/agent/, so the trajectory
    and answer are on disk and the trial can be graded normally. Swallowing it here is the same
    judgement Harbor already made for exit 143, applied to the other half of the same teardown.

    The same teardown has more than one spelling, which is what `_TEARDOWN_ERRORS` is for. Against
    Harbor 0.20.0 every kimi rollout instead raised

        httpx.ConnectError: Error reading content

    so the original `RemoteProtocolError`-only guard no longer matched and all 15 cells of a
    compatibility matrix failed — each one AFTER capturing real work (up to 12 turns and 1320
    trainable tokens, `atif=match` throughout). One transport layer's way of saying "the stream you
    were reading went away" is not stable across versions, so the guard lists the ways rather than
    assuming one.

    Still deliberately narrow, and the safety net is downstream rather than here: if the sandbox had
    genuinely been unreachable, the agent would have made no model calls, and `check_rollout`'s
    `no_turns` FATAL fails the rollout anyway. So swallowing a transport error cannot promote a
    never-ran rollout to a graded one. Anything outside this list still raises.

# pi, taught to talk to our intercept. Registered via `AgentConfig.import_path`, no Harbor patch.
#
# THE PROBLEM. Harbor's `pi` wrapper forwards a fixed list of API-key variables and nothing else
# (installed/pi.py:100-137). It has no base-URL handling at all, and unlike opencode there is no
# `_build_register_config_command` hook to write a provider config. Pointed at our intercept, pi ignores
# `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, calls api.openai.com with our session id as the key, and dies:
#
#     OpenAI API error (401): Incorrect API key provided: sc6f2e5a…
#     You can find your API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
#
# THE FIX. pi reads custom providers from `~/.pi/agent/models.json`
# (https://pi.dev/docs/latest/custom-provider). Harbor gives us no hook to write it, but it does let an
# agent be supplied by `import_path`, so we subclass `Pi`, write the file in `setup()`, and register
# the subclass. Harbor is untouched.
#
#     AgentConfig(import_path="harnesses.pi_agent:InterceptPi", ...)
#
# This is the general escape hatch for any harness whose config Harbor does not know how to write:
# subclass locally, override `setup()`, register by import path.
#
# TWO DETAILS THAT MATTER.
#
# `api` must be `openai-completions`. Left to its own devices pi picks `openai-responses` for a provider
# named `openai` (we watched it do exactly that: `"api":"openai-responses"` in its session log). The
# intercept handles both, but chat-completions is the dialect with the least translation and by far the
# most mileage on it.
#
# The provider is NOT named `openai`. A distinct name keeps pi off its built-in OpenAI defaults, the
# same reason opencode's provider is called `intercepted`.
