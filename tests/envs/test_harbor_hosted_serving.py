"""Serving on a hosted platform, where there is one port and one URL.

Locally the capture proxy runs on its own port and is published to the sandbox. A Space exposes
exactly one port and already has a public URL, so the proxy is mounted onto the env server's app
instead and nothing is forwarded. These tests pin that split, because getting it wrong is not a
crash: it is a deployment that quietly opens a second listener it cannot publish.
