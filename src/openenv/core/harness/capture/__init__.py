"""Token-level capture for agentic rollouts.

An OpenAI-spec proxy that sits between a coding agent and an inference engine, recording the exact
token ids and logprobs of every model call so a rollout can be trained on.

The core idea is that nothing is ever tokenised locally. The engine returns `prompt_token_ids`, so
turn k+1's prompt IS the canonical tokenisation of everything before it, and turns are linked by
exact token prefix. Re-rendering a prompt offline drifts from what the model actually saw, and a
drifted prompt silently fragments one long conversation into several short ones.

Four wire dialects are supported (chat-completions, Responses, Anthropic Messages, Google
generateContent) because coding agents did not agree on one. Validated across 16 harnesses, each
cross-checked against the harness's own trace.
