"""Loop-owning sessions backed by a deployed `harbor_env` server.

    factory = HarborSessionFactory(server_url="http://harbor:8000", split="...", llm_url="http://vllm:8000")
    session = factory.create(prompt)      # prompt carries the task's instruction
    session.wait_for_completion()         # the server runs the agent; this blocks
    trace = session.fetch_proxy_trace()   # per-turn records for a trainer
    reward = session.verify(transcript)   # the task's own verifier, forwarded

This is the shape TRL's `HarnessRolloutWorker` consumes in loop-owning mode, and it is deliberately
the same shape `opencode_env.harness` offers — so the training script is the stock one and nothing has
to be added to TRL. The difference is where the work happens: opencode_env runs the agent locally,
while this hands a task to a server that owns the sandbox, the agent and the capture proxy. The
trainer needs no sandbox credentials, no harness installed, and no capture plumbing of its own.

WHY THE ENGINE IS AN ARGUMENT HERE. `run_rollout` takes `llm_url` per call, so a trainer points the
server at the vLLM it is currently syncing weights into. The server probes that engine and the tier
follows from what it can return: token ids plus processed logprobs give a trainable rollout, anything
less gives an eval one. That is what lets a training run and an eval run share one server.

ONE HONEST LIMITATION. `fetch_proxy_trace` returns TRL's `TraceEntry` shape, which has no field for
the prompt's token ids, so TRL re-renders each prompt with `apply_chat_template`. The completions are
exact — they come straight off the engine — but the prompts are not guaranteed to be. Whether that
matters is measurable rather than arguable: `measure_prompt_skew` below compares the re-render against
the engine's own `prompt_token_ids` for the model and harness you are actually using. If it is 1.0 the
path is lossless; if it is not, `_chain_to_sequences` forks the conversation at the first divergence,
so it degrades visibly rather than silently.
