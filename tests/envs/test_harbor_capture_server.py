"""Port-ownership guarantees for the capture proxy.

A capture server that reports healthy while a *different* process owns its port is the worst
failure this layer has: sessions are minted in one registry and validated against another, so the
agent is rejected with 401, every rollout reports zero model calls, and the UI shows a live view
that can never advance. Nothing in that chain names the port, so these tests pin the invariant that
`start()` refuses rather than proceeds.

No credentials and no engine are needed: `start()` binds a socket and never contacts `llm_url`.
