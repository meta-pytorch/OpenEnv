"""`.claude/hooks/lint.sh` must never modify the working tree.

The hook says so itself ("Undo the formatting so the working tree stays
as-is"), and `/alignment-review` and `/pre-submit-pr` run it automatically, so
an author can trigger it without meaning to. It previously formatted in place
and then ran `git checkout --` on whatever changed, which restores from HEAD:
that discarded the formatting *and* any uncommitted edits in the same files,
and left reformatted Markdown behind because the restore only covered `*.py`.

These run the real hook against a throwaway git repo with a stub `uv` on PATH,
so no formatter is actually invoked and the test is hermetic. The stub rewrites
files in "format" mode and reports status in "check" mode, which is enough to
tell a hook that writes from one that only reports.
