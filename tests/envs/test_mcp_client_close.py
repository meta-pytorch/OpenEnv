"""`close()` on an MCP client must actually close it.

`EnvClient.close` is synchronous and dispatches to `_close_async` via `_dispatch`, which returns an
awaitable in async code and a result in sync code — so one definition serves `client.close()` and
`await client.close()` both. `MCPClientBase` used to override `close` itself with an `async def`, which
silently broke every synchronous caller: the call built a coroutine, dropped it un-awaited, and
returned as if it had worked.

Nothing errored. The websocket stayed open, so the server never reached its `_destroy_session`
cleanup, and sessions accumulated until `max_concurrent_envs` was exhausted. Measured against a live
server with a cap of 16: exactly 16 of 20 connect-and-close cycles succeeded and the rest failed with
`ConnectionClosedOK`, which reads as a network fault rather than a leak. In a training run, where every
rollout takes a session, that is a wall the run hits partway through.
