"""Execution backends that implement Harbor's sandbox contract.

Harbor tasks are written against a fixed filesystem layout inside the sandbox:

| Path              | Contents                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| working directory | what the agent edits (the image's `WORKDIR`)            |
| `/tests`          | the task's `tests/`, staged by the harness before verify |
| `/solution`       | the task's `solution/`, staged only for the oracle       |
| `/logs/verifier`  | where the verifier writes `reward.json` / `reward.txt`   |
| `/logs/agent`     | scratch space for agent logs                             |

[`Sandbox`] encodes that layout and the episode phases once; subclasses only
provide five primitives (boot, exec, read, write, upload). Two backends ship:

- [`DockerSandbox`] — runs inside the task's own image. This is the faithful
  backend and the only one that can run tasks whose starting state lives in an
  image (everything `repo2rlenv` emits with an `environment/Dockerfile`).
- [`LocalSandbox`] — runs as subprocesses under a per-episode root directory.
  No Docker, so it works on Hugging Face Spaces, and it is exact for
  *self-contained* tasks that ship their starting state as `environment/` seed
  files.
