"""The engine is a per-rollout property, not a per-server one.

A dataset server is the expensive thing to keep alive: thousands of task files, prebuilt sandbox
templates. An inference engine is the cheap, changing part — it restarts every training run, and a
train-tier engine and an eval-tier one are usually both wanted against the same task suite. Pinning
the engine at boot made the durable thing hostage to the ephemeral one: no URL meant no capture proxy
at all, and every rollout answered "server not initialised".

So a caller names its engine when it mints a session, that engine is probed THEN (so the caller learns
its tier at submit time rather than when the token fields come back empty), and the measurement is
cached per engine so a whole GRPO group naming one vLLM pays for it once.
