class HarnessEnvironment(MCPEnvironment):
    """
    Environment that wraps an external turn-based agentic harness.

    In simulation mode, `reset()` starts a fresh harness process and
    conversation, and each `step()` with a [`~openenv.core.harness.environment.HarnessAction`]
    is one conversational turn: the harness runs its internal ReAct loop and
    the response is returned as an observation. The harness keeps conversation
    context across turns; the training loop controls episode boundaries.
    MCP actions (`ListToolsAction`, `CallToolAction`) keep their standard
    routing so orchestrators can inspect and invoke domain tools directly.

    Environment MCP tools are conflict-resolved against the adapter's built-in
    tool names and injected into the harness before it starts. Rubrics run
    after each turn completes, outside the harness's control loop.

    Factories used with `HTTPEnvServer` must construct a fresh adapter per
    environment instance — adapters own a single harness process and must not
    be shared. Constructing the environment starts nothing; the harness
    process and any tool bridge start on `reset()`.

    Args:
        adapter ([`~openenv.core.harness.adapter.AgenticHarnessAdapter`]):
            Adapter owning the harness process lifecycle.
        mcp (`FastMCP`, *optional*):
            Environment-specific MCP tools to inject into the harness. When
            `None`, an empty internal server is used and nothing is injected.
        rubric ([`~openenv.core.rubrics.Rubric`], *optional*):
            Reward rubric applied to each turn's observation.
        transform (`Transform`, *optional*):
            Optional observation transform (inherited from `Environment`).
