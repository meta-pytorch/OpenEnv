# OpenApp Environment

<img src="assets/OpenApps_OpenEnv_RL.png" alt="OpenApps Environment" width="800"/>

*A web application simulation environment for OpenEnv that wraps the [OpenApps](https://github.com/facebookresearch/OpenApps) framework and BrowserGym.*

</div>

## Overview

The OpenApp environment provides a simulated web application ecosystem where agents can interact with various apps (calendar, todo, messenger, maps) using browser-based actions.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/openapps-demo.gif" alt="OpenApps Demo" width="600"/>
</div>

This environment is ideal for:

- Training and evaluating UI agents
- Testing web automation strategies
- Researching human-computer interaction
- Developing multimodal agents

## Features

- **Multiple Apps**: Interact with calendar, todo list, messenger, and map applications
- **Browser-Based Actions**: Click, fill forms, navigate, scroll, and more
- **Task-Based Evaluation**: Optional task goals with automatic reward calculation
- **Configurable**: Customize app configurations and behavior
- **BrowserGym Integration**: Built on top of BrowserGym for robust browser interaction

## Installation

### For Docker Usage (Recommended)

Docker mode is fully self-contained and requires no additional setup:

```bash
cd src/envs/openapp_env
pip install -e .
playwright install chromium
```

Then build and use the Docker image - OpenApps is included in the container.

### For Local Development

Local mode requires both the Python package and the OpenApps repository:

**Step 1: Install openapp_env**
```bash
cd src/envs/openapp_env
pip install -e .
```

This installs OpenApps as a Python package dependency along with BrowserGym, Playwright, etc.

**Step 2: Install Playwright browsers**
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

**Step 3: Get OpenApps repository** (for running the server)
```bash
# Clone OpenApps to run the server
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/OpenApps.git
cd OpenApps
uv sync
```

**Why both?**
- The Python package (installed via pip) provides the OpenApps modules
- The repository clone provides launch.py and config files to run the server
- Docker mode includes everything, so you only need it for local development

## Quick Start

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to use OpenApp environment is with Docker, which handles all the setup automatically:

```bash
python examples/openapp_example.py --mode docker
```

### Running Locally

For local usage, you need the OpenApps repository to run the server:

**Step 1: Clone OpenApps (if you haven't already)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/OpenApps.git
cd OpenApps
uv sync
```

**Step 2: Start OpenApps Server** (in terminal 1)
```bash
cd OpenApps  # or wherever you cloned it
uv run launch.py
```

Wait for the server to start (you'll see "Port 5001 is available" or similar).

**Step 3: Run your code** (in terminal 2)
```bash
export OPENAPPS_URL=http://localhost:5001
python examples/openapp_example.py --mode local
```

**Note:** The OpenApps Python package (installed via pip) provides the modules, but you need the full repository to run launch.py with its config files.

### Example Script

```bash
# Run with Docker (recommended)
python examples/openapp_example.py --mode docker

# Run locally (requires OpenApps server running)
export OPENAPPS_URL=http://localhost:5001
python examples/openapp_example.py --mode local

# Show browser window to visualize agent actions
python examples/openapp_example.py --mode local --show-browser

# Run with custom number of steps
python examples/openapp_example.py --mode docker --num-steps 20

# See all options
python examples/openapp_example.py --help
```

### Visualizing Agent Interactions

There are multiple ways to see what the agent is doing:

**Option 1: Show Browser Window**
```bash
# Watch the agent interact with apps in real-time
python examples/openapp_example.py --mode local --show-browser
```

**Option 2: Access Web Interface Directly**

While the OpenApps server is running, open your browser to:
- Main page: `http://localhost:5001`
- Calendar: `http://localhost:5001/calendar`
- Todo: `http://localhost:5001/todo`
- Messenger: `http://localhost:5001/messenger`
- Maps: `http://localhost:5001/maps`

**Option 3: Docker Web Interface**

When running in Docker mode, access the web interface at:
```
http://localhost:8000/web
```

This provides an interactive UI for manual testing and API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Basic Usage

```python
from envs.openapp_env import OpenAppAction, OpenAppEnv

# Create environment from Docker image
client = OpenAppEnv.from_docker_image("openapp-env:latest")

# Reset to initial state
result = client.reset()
print(f"Starting URL: {result.observation.url}")

# Navigate to calendar app
result = client.step(OpenAppAction(
    action_type="goto",
    url="http://localhost:5001/calendar"
))

# Click on a button (example bid)
result = client.step(OpenAppAction(
    action_type="click",
    bid="add-event-btn"
))

# Fill in a form field
result = client.step(OpenAppAction(
    action_type="fill",
    bid="event-title-input",
    text="Team Meeting"
))

print(f"Reward: {result.reward}")
print(f"Done: {result.done}")

# Cleanup
client.close()
```

### Action Types

The environment supports the following action types:

- **click**: Click on an element
  - Required: `bid` (BrowserGym element ID)

- **fill**: Fill a text input field
  - Required: `bid`, `text`

- **select_option**: Select from dropdown
  - Required: `bid`, `value`

- **goto**: Navigate to a URL
  - Required: `url`

- **scroll**: Scroll the page
  - Required: `direction` ("up" or "down")

- **send_keys**: Send keyboard input
  - Required: `text`

- **noop**: No operation

### Observations

Each observation includes:

- **html**: Current page HTML content
- **url**: Current page URL
- **open_pages_urls**: List of all open page URLs
- **active_page_index**: Index of currently active page
- **screenshot**: Base64-encoded screenshot (optional)
- **axtree_txt**: Accessibility tree for element interaction
- **app_state**: Current state of all apps (calendar events, todos, messages, etc.)
- **task_info**: Information about current task (if using tasks)
- **last_action_error**: Error message if last action failed

## Configuration

### Environment Parameters

```python
from envs.openapp_env.server.openapp_environment import OpenAppEnvironment

env = OpenAppEnvironment(
    web_app_port=5001,                   # Port for OpenApps server
    headless=True,                       # Run browser in headless mode
    task_name="add_meeting",             # Optional task name
    apps_config={},                      # App-specific configuration
    max_steps=50,                        # Maximum steps per episode
)
```

**Note:** OpenApps is automatically detected from the installed Python package. You can optionally override with `openapps_path` parameter or `OPENAPPS_PATH` environment variable if needed.

## Building Docker Image

The OpenApp environment Docker image can be built in standalone mode using only public base images. This makes it suitable for CI/CD, GitHub, and HuggingFace deployments.

```bash
# Build from project root
docker build -t openapp-env:latest -f src/envs/openapp_env/server/Dockerfile src/envs/openapp_env

# Or build from the openapp_env directory
cd src/envs/openapp_env
docker build -t openapp-env:latest -f server/Dockerfile .
```

**What gets installed:**

The Dockerfile uses the `pyproject.toml` to install all dependencies:
- **OpenEnv core**: Installed as a dependency
- **Core packages**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, Requests (from pyproject.toml)
- **BrowserGym**: For browser automation
- **Playwright**: Chromium browser for UI interaction
- **Web interface support**: Enabled by default via `ENABLE_WEB_INTERFACE=true`

**Build details:**
- Base image: `python:3.11-slim` (public)
- Installation: Uses `pip install -e .` with pyproject.toml
- System deps: Playwright/Chromium dependencies for browser automation
- Size: ~1.5-2GB (includes Chromium browser)

## Tasks and Rewards

The environment can be configured with specific tasks from OpenApps. Tasks define:
- Goal state (e.g., "Add a meeting with Dennis to the calendar")
- Reward function based on app state changes
- Success criteria

See [OpenApps documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/) for available tasks.

## Example: Task-Based Training

```python
from envs.openapp_env import OpenAppAction, OpenAppEnv

# Create environment with a specific task
client = OpenAppEnv.from_docker_image("openapp-env:latest")

# The task will guide the agent toward a specific goal
# Rewards will be based on progress toward completing the task
result = client.reset()

# Agent interacts to complete the task
# ... agent logic here ...

client.close()
```

## Development

### Running Server Locally (without Docker)

```bash
cd src/envs/openapp_env
uv run server
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:8000`

### Testing

```python
from envs.openapp_env.server.openapp_environment import OpenAppEnvironment
from envs.openapp_env.models import OpenAppAction

def test_environment():
    env = OpenAppEnvironment()

    # Test reset
    obs = env.reset()
    assert obs.url != ""

    # Test step
    action = OpenAppAction(action_type="noop")
    obs = env.step(action)
    assert env.state.step_count == 1

    # Cleanup
    env.close()

test_environment()
```
