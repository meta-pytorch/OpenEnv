"""How each Harbor harness is pointed at the intercept server.

This is the ONLY per-agent knowledge in the stack, and it is deliberately data. For every Harbor
agent the only thing that differs is which env var or config key carries the base URL and the API
key. Sandbox, capture, stitching, masking and validation are identical downstream.

A seam has:
    env         env vars set in OUR process. Harbor's installed agents read os.environ at
                construction and forward the provider-relevant subset into the sandbox.
    model_fmt   what to pass as Harbor's `model_name`. Several agents derive their provider from
                the prefix, so this is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
    dialect     the wire format we expect. Informational: the server detects per request. Recorded
                so a surprise in capture is checkable against what we predicted.
    kwargs      optional (base_url, session, model) -> dict merged into AgentConfig.kwargs, for
                agents needing more than env vars.
    status      what to trust, and the only field a caller should filter on:

                  "validated"     an end-to-end run passed the capture contract AND the ATIF
                                  cross-check. Safe for cross-model and cross-harness comparison.
                  "unstable:<why>" runs and grades, but cannot be budgeted -- it ignores the step
                                  cap, so one rollout can consume a sweep. Reachable explicitly;
                                  deliberately absent from the validated set and the UI picker.
                  "unsupported:<why>" observed to produce unusable results. Worse than an error
                                  when it scores a countable 0.0, because that reads as a weak
                                  model rather than a broken harness.
                  "blocked:<why>" cannot run here at all -- missing credentials or registry entry.
                  "untested"      no end-to-end run yet, however plausible it looks.

                Measured 2026-09-01/02 over 16,000 rollouts on HuggingEnvs/data-agent-harbor-test:
                10 validated, 2 unstable, 3 unsupported.

The API key is always the intercept session id. That is the multiplexing scheme: one server, one
port, N concurrent rollouts, each identified by the key its agent was handed.

Per-harness findings live in README.md (per-harness findings). Add to it as each agent is brought up.

    """The model name to hand a harness, derived from what the engine actually serves.

    THE PROBLEM. A vLLM started without `--served-model-name` serves under its full repo id, e.g.
    `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B`. Every seam then formats that into its own provider prefix and produces a
    two-slash name:

        model_fmt="openai/{model}"  ->  "openai/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B"

    Harnesses disagree about what that means. gemini-cli requires exactly `provider/model_name` and
    rejects anything else ("Model name must be in the format provider/model_name"); cline-cli wants
    `provider:model` with a colon; several split on the FIRST slash and several on the LAST, so the
    same string resolves to different models depending on the agent. All of them are "working as
    documented" — the string is just ambiguous.

    WHY STRIPPING IS SAFE. The harness-facing name and the upstream name are already decoupled: the
    intercept overwrites `chat_request["model"]` with the configured served id on every request
    (`capture/server.py`), so whatever a harness puts on the wire is replaced before it reaches the
    engine. The harness-facing name only has to be something the harness can parse and route to us;
    it never has to match the engine.

    So: take the leaf. `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` -> `Qwen3.5-9B`, and a name with no slash is unchanged.
    This is preferred over relaunching the engine with `--served-model-name` because it works against
    an engine you do not control, including a shared or hosted one.

# Every ATIF-capable agent Harbor registers. This IS the goal.
#
# Source of truth is Harbor's own `SUPPORTS_ATIF` class flag, not a grep for trajectory imports.
# The grep undercounted (25 vs 29): it missed antigravity-sdk, cline-cli, nemo-agent and
# openhands-sdk, which build ATIF without importing the models in a way grep could see. Re-derive with:
#
#   getattr(import_class(AgentFactory._AGENT_MAP[a], label="agent"), "SUPPORTS_ATIF", False)
#
# computer-1 is deliberately excluded: not needed for this goal.
# Every agent whose Harbor class sets SUPPORTS_ATIF, minus two deliberate exclusions.
#
# `computer-1` is out of scope by request.
#
# `openhands` (V0) is out because Harbor registers it and `openhands-sdk` as two SEPARATE agents,
# not as old and new names for one. V0 bundles the full `openhands-ai` with its own Docker runtime;
# the SDK runs directly in the container. Running a Docker runtime inside a sandbox that is already
# a container is the wrong shape for this work, and the SDK validated 5/5 with zero fixes while V0
# needed four packaging patches and still did not come through. Its Seam and InterceptOpenHands
# subclass are kept so `--agents openhands` still works; it is simply not a target.
# `nemo-agent` is out as well. Harbor generates its NAT config as
# `workflow: {_type: chat_completion}`: a single-shot LLM call with no tools and no loop, so ONE
# turn is correct behaviour, not a failure. Making it agentic needs a react_agent workflow plus
# NAT's `code_execution` tool, which requires a separate sandbox service (docker or Piston) that
# would not even have the task's CSV. Bring-your-own-workflow, like eve and acp.
# `antigravity-sdk` is out too. Its Go `localharness` binary receives a correctly-translated
# functionCall (verified by direct probe) and then ends the conversation without executing it, the
# SDK's "Received tool call %s but no tool runner is configured. Yielding to user." path. That is
# inside google-antigravity, and Harbor's runner sets the root logger to ERROR so the warning that
# would confirm it never reaches a log. Seam kept; not a target.
