"""The rollout graph: every model call a harness made, linked by token prefix.

A rollout is not a list of turns. Harnesses retry, spawn subagents, generate titles, and compact
context, and all of it arrives on one wire looking identical. A flat list forces you to guess which
turns belong together; a graph records it.

    node        one model call: the prompt the server tokenized, the tokens it sampled back
    parent      the call whose prompt+completion is a token-prefix of this call's prompt
    root        a call that extends nothing (a new conversation: the agent's, a subagent's,
                a title generator's, or the continuation after a context compaction)
    path        root -> leaf, which is exactly one training sequence

Everything downstream is a walk. `sequences()` concatenates a path into
`input_ids / loss_mask / logprobs`; branch structure tells you which paths are the agent's work and
which are discards.

WHY A GRAPH AND NOT PREFIX-MERGED CHAINS. Three things fall out of it that a chain cannot express:

  * **Retries become visible.** A retried turn is a sibling that never continued: same parent, no
    children. A proxy cannot ask the harness what it discarded, but the shape of the graph shows it.
  * **Subagents separate themselves.** A subagent has its own system prompt, so its first call
    extends nothing and starts its own root. No system-prompt keyword matching required.
  * **Compaction is representable.** A rewritten history is not a prefix extension, so it opens a
    new root instead of corrupting the chain it came from.

TOKEN FIDELITY. We never tokenize. The inference server tokenizes each prompt as a side effect of
serving it and returns `prompt_token_ids`, so turn k+1's prompt IS the canonical tokenization of
everything up to that point, including the tool results the harness inserted. Assistant bodies come
back as sampled `token_ids` with aligned logprobs. So for any path:

    concat(node.context_ids + node.sampled_ids for node in path)

reproduces, exactly, the token sequences the model actually saw and produced. Nothing is re-rendered
through a local chat template, which is the single largest source of silent train/inference skew.
