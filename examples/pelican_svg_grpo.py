"""Train a small policy to draw with TRL's GRPOTrainer on `pelican_svg_env`.

Single-step env, so this is a plain prompt -> completion -> reward GRPO setup.

**The vision judge is off during training, on purpose.** Every judged sample
costs two multimodal API calls, which at a few hundred rollouts a step is both
slow and expensive, and a judge that varies run to run makes the reward curve
unreadable. With the judge disabled the environment scores on the deterministic
structural layer alone and the whole reward is reproducible arithmetic.

That choice sets up the experiment worth running. The structural layer can be
satisfied by two circles, a bar and a blob: it is a proxy, and the interesting question
is whether a model optimising it learns to *draw* or learns to *game it*. So the
script scores a held-out sample with the judge before and after training. If
structure goes up and the judged score does not follow, the policy found the
proxy rather than the task, and that is a result rather than a failure.
