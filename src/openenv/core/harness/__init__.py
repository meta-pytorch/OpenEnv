"""Harness integration helpers for training, evaluation, and wrapping agents.

This package hosts two complementary layers:

1. **Trainer-side rollout API** (``openenv.core.harness.rollout``): a harness
   drives an entire episode in one call (``run_white_box``/``run_black_box``)
   against a resource session. Used by ``openenv collect`` and the training
   tutorials.
2. **Turn-based agentic harness API** (RFC 005): an external harness such as
   OpenClaw or Claude Code runs inside the environment container, and each
   ``step()`` is one conversational turn. See
   [`~openenv.core.harness.environment.HarnessEnvironment`] and
   [`~openenv.core.harness.adapter.AgenticHarnessAdapter`].

Both layers are importable from ``openenv.core.harness``.
