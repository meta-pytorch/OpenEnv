Sequences are labelled rather than filtered. A caller that silently drops rows cannot be
distinguished from one that had none to drop, and "the group quietly shrank" is far harder to
diagnose than "three rows were labelled auxiliary". The trainer picks by `role`.

ROLE ASSIGNMENT is structural first, heuristic only as a tiebreak. A rollout's real work is the
longest path with tool access; a title generator or a summariser is a short toolless root. The old
approach (matching known system-prompt strings) needed a new entry per harness and failed silently
on the harnesses nobody had profiled yet.

    **Multiple agent paths are normal and all of them are trainable.** A harness that rewrites its
    system prompt mid-run breaks token-prefix continuity and starts a new root, even though the
    conversation continued: claude-code does exactly this, swapping a 12118-char system prompt for a
    12541-char one at call 6 while its message list grows 2 -> 26 unbroken. Both roots are the agent
    doing real work on the same task and earn the same reward.

    An earlier version kept only the single longest tool-using path. On opencode that was
    indistinguishable from correct (its second root really is a title generator), but on claude-code
    it silently discarded 6 genuine agent turns. Tool access alone is the honest signal: aux calls
    essentially never pass a tool manifest, and coding agents essentially always do.
