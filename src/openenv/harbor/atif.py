"""Reconcile our token capture against Harbor's ATIF trajectory. The independent cross-check.

Harbor agents write `agent/trajectory.json` in ATIF (Agent Trajectory Interchange Format, currently
v1.7), a published spec for logging agent interaction histories across debugging, SFT and RL. ~27 of
Harbor's agents build ATIF trajectories, which is far more than the six the docs list.

Why this matters more than it sounds. ATIF and the intercept measure the same rollout through
completely independent paths: the harness counts its own tokens and reports them to Harbor, while we
derive ours from engine-returned token ids stitched along a graph. If they agree turn by turn, the
masking, the turn segmentation and the prefix stitching are all correct simultaneously. Nothing else
we can run gives that assurance, because every internal check shares our own assumptions.

Validated on opencode + Qwen3.5-4B, 8 agent steps:

    ATIF completion_tokens : [37, 36, 104, 264, 255, 119, 32, 27]   total 874
    intercept turn_lengths : [37, 36, 104, 264, 255, 119, 32, 27]   total 874
    ATIF step-1 prompt_tokens 7990  ==  intercept prompt_len 7990

ATIF also carries three things a proxy structurally cannot see, which is the other half of the value:

    llm_call_count          >1 means the harness burned several model calls on one logical step,
                            i.e. it retried. A proxy sees the calls but not that they were retries.
    subagent_trajectories   nested trajectories (v1.7). Ground truth for which turns are a subagent,
                            instead of inferring it from graph roots.
    tool_call_id <-> observation.source_call_id
                            which tool result answered which call.

`Metrics` in ATIF has optional `logprobs` and `completion_token_ids` fields, which harnesses leave
empty. So the end state is not two formats to reconcile: it is ATIF with our token fields filled in,
one artifact that is trace, SFT dataset and RL data at once. `merge_into_atif` does that.
