"""Dataset discovery: resolve Harbor task sets and serve them over OpenEnv's Task API.

`HarborTaskProvider` satisfies `openenv.core.env_server.interfaces.TaskProvider`, so the HTTP routes
(`/{env}/splits`, `/{env}/tasks`, `/{env}/task`, ...) come for free once an environment exposes it.

Two constraints from that Protocol shape the design, and both are easy to violate:

  * **it must be side-effect free.** Discovery must not boot a sandbox or start a job.
  * **it must work on a freshly constructed instance.** The route handlers build a throwaway
    environment per request purely to answer, so anything expensive has to be cached at module level
    rather than on `self`, or every `/task` call re-downloads a dataset.

Three source kinds, resolved by shape:

    AdithyaSK/data_agent_rl_environment_train   HF dataset repo  -> snapshot_download
    /path/to/tasks                              local directory
    terminal-bench@1.0                          Harbor registry name@version

Harbor has no HuggingFace path of its own — its datasets are git repos or Harbor Hub packages. But an
HF dataset laid out as `tasks/<name>/` is already a directory of Harbor task dirs, so downloading it
and pointing Harbor's local mode at the result needs no new concepts.

# there in `ls`.

# does not preserve symlinks, Modal's tar-based one does — so it presents as "Modal is broken".
