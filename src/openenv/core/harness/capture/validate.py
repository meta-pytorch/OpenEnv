"""Token-in / token-out validation. Nothing leaves this system unchecked.

Capture failures in this stack are silent by construction. Every bug found so far returned a
perfectly well-formed payload and reported success: a missing `--return-tokens-as-token-ids` yields
text with no ids and trains on nothing; a harness that rewrites its history yields chains that stitch
into a trajectory the model never saw; an SSE client handed a JSON body yields zero tokens and no
error anywhere. None of these raise. All of them produce plausible JSON.

So validation is not a debug aid here, it is the only thing standing between a clean-looking run and
weeks of training on corrupted sequences. Checks are graded:

    FATAL    the row is not trainable. Drop it. Training on it is worse than dropping it.
    WARN     the row is trainable but something is off and should be understood.
    INFO     recorded for the per-harness notes.

`check_upstream` runs before a rollout is spent (endpoint capability), `check_turn` runs per model
call (token/logprob alignment), `check_sequence` runs on the flattened output (mask/logprob
invariants), and `check_rollout` runs on the whole graph (structure).
