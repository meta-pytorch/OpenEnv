"""Turn a provider's 400 into the one edit that would have made the request work.

Hosted providers reject parameters a local vLLM accepts, and they reject them per *model* rather
than per endpoint, so no static table can be right. What they do give is a machine-readable reason,
and it names the offending field:

    max_tokens     Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model.
                   Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead.          (code: unsupported_parameter)
    temperature    Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0 with this model. Only the
                   default (1) value is supported.               (code: unsupported_value)
    logprobs       Unsupported parameter: 'logprobs' is not supported with this model.
    return_token_ids
                   Unrecognized request argument supplied: return_token_ids   (code: null)
                   Unknown parameter: 'return_token_ids'.        (code: unknown_parameter)
    reasoning_effort
                   Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported for gpt-5.6-sol in
                   /v1/chat/completions. To use function tools, use /v1/responses or set
                   reasoning_effort to 'none'.                   (param: null, code: null)

All were observed live: the first three on `gpt-5.5` and every `gpt-5.6-*`, the last on `gpt-4o-mini`
and `gpt-5.6-*` respectively. Note the last two — the *same* rejection of the *same* parameter,
phrased two ways by two models of the same vendor, one of them not populating `error.param` at all.
That is the reason this reads several shapes rather than matching one string, and the reason
`error.param` is preferred but not required.

It matters because the agent, not this layer, chooses most of these params — opencode, codex and
qwen-coder all send `max_tokens` and a temperature — so a harness that works against vLLM would
otherwise 400 on every single call against a current OpenAI model.

The last one is the sharpest, and the only fix here that changes model *behaviour* rather than
spelling: `reasoning_effort: "none"` turns reasoning off, so what gets evaluated is not quite what the
harness asked for. It is applied anyway because the alternative is that every tools-bearing call fails
and the agent does nothing at all — but for that reason every applied fix is recorded on the result,
in the startup report and in the UI, never silently. The better answer is the Responses route, which
the provider's own message recommends.

`diagnose` is deliberately conservative. It returns a fix only when it can name the parameter, it
never touches a field the request cannot lose (`model`, `messages`, `input`), and a caller is
expected to bound how many fixes it will accept before giving up. Guessing wrong here turns a clear
400 into a silently different request, which is worse than the 400.
