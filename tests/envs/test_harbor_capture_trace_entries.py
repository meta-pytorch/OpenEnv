"""The loop-owning training endpoint, and the contract types it serves.

`GET /sessions/{id}/trace_entries` exists because a loop-owning consumer -- an external agent that
drives its own tool loop, opencode or codex or claude-code -- wants per-model-call records, not the
stitched sequence document `/rollout` returns. `to_trace_entries` already produced that shape but
could not be asked for it over HTTP, because it needs the session's graph and that is server-side
state.

These tests pin the two things a consumer depends on and cannot check for itself:

  * the endpoint answers with `{"session_id", "entries"}` and 404s an unknown id rather than 500ing,
    so a caller can distinguish "no such rollout" from "the server broke";
  * `TraceEntry` carries exactly the five keys the record is defined to have. A consumer builds
    training rows off those key names, so a rename is a silent breakage -- the trainer would read
    empty token fields and report a rollout that learned nothing.

No engine is contacted: `llm_url` is the discard port, so a stray request would fail loudly.
