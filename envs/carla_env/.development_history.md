# Development History (Internal Reference)

This file documents the incremental development process for internal reference only.
Not relevant for end users - features are documented in README.md.

## Feature Development Timeline

### Day 1: Core Environment
- Basic CARLA environment setup
- Mock mode implementation
- Emergency stop and lane change actions
- Text-based scene descriptions

### Day 2: Enhanced Actions
- `brake_vehicle` with intensity parameter (0.0-1.0)
- `maintain_speed` cruise control
- Improved `lane_change` with target_lane_id support
- Enhanced action flexibility

### Day 3: Metrics & Tracking
- Action tracking metrics (from sinatras)
- Tool call counts per episode
- Movement metrics (average/max speed, distance)
- Collision history and intensity tracking

### Day 4: Navigation Actions
- Navigation agent initialization
- Set destination coordinates
- Follow route functionality
- Integration with CARLA navigation agents
- Maze scenarios with goal tracking

### Day 5: Camera Support
- Optional RGB camera sensor
- Third-person view (behind vehicle)
- Base64-encoded JPEG frames
- Configurable resolution and FOV
- Real mode only (not in mock)

## Implementation Notes

All features are production-ready and documented in README.md.
